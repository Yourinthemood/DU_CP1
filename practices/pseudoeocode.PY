# Define a function to start a new game tic tac toe
#define function by naming it tic_tac_toe():
# PUT THE FUNCTION INSIDE A WHILE LOOP SO IT CAN RESTART IF THE USER WANTS TO PLAY AGAIN
#  initialize variables for the game {'1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9'}
#   set up the game board as a list of 9 empty strings
#ask heads or tails
#  do a coin toss by generating a random number (0 or 1)
#  if the number is 0, the user is heads, otherwise tails
#if value flipped is 0 or heads then set user to X and computer to O
# if value flipped is 1 or tails then set user to O and computer to X
#  display the fcoin toss by saying "You are X" or "You are O"
# x will go first
#  set current player to X
#  while the game is not over:
#    display the current game board
#    if current player is user:
#      ask the user to enter a position (1-9) and show a board with numbers to indicate positions
#      if the position is valid and empty, place the user's mark (X or O) on the board
#      if they choose an invalid position, ask again
#     if else:
#      generate a random position (1-9) for the computer
# if the position is valid and empty, place the computer's mark (X or O) on the board
#      if the position is invalid, generate a new position
#    check if the current player has won by checking all winning combinations
#    if the current player has won, display the board and announce the winner
#    if the board is full and no one has won, display the board and announce a tie
#    switch the current player (X to O or O to X)
#  ask if the user wants to play again (yes/no)
#  if yes, reset the board and start a new game
